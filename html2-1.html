        <h1>Smite (video game)</h1>
        Smite is a free-to-play, third-person multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Hi-Rez Studios 
        for Microsoft Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In Smite, players control a god, goddess, or other mythological figure 
        and take part in team based combat, using abilities and tactics against other player-controlled gods and non-player-controlled minions.

        The game has multiple player versus player modes, many playable characters, and has a successful eSports scene with multiple tournaments, 
        including the annual Smite World Championship which has a million dollar prize pool.
        
        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        Smite features many different game modes, with the largest being Conquest. Players are formed into two teams, with five players to each team. 
        All players begin at opposite sides of a map at their team's 'fountain'. Before the players enter the map, they are granted an amount of gold 
        (usually 1,500) to buy starting items. These items grant special bonuses or abilities that enhance the player's god. There are three continuous 
        'lanes' running from one side of the map to the other. Each lane is defended by a 'Phoenix' which is accompanied by a pair of extra defensive towers. 
        Phoenixes and towers deal a large amount of damage to any enemies that come too close. The goal of each game is to destroy the opposing team's Phoenixes 
        and the Titan, a giant warrior who must be defeated to win the game. The players are accompanied by 'minions', small soldiers with a weak attack; these 
        minions spawn at the Phoenixes every thirty seconds and run along their lane until they meet opposition and attack immediately. Minions will attack 
        not only players and other minions but also towers, Phoenixes and the Titan; in fact, their presence is required for players to deal full damage to 
        these objectives. Defensive positions will prioritize enemy minions over players, allowing players to attack a tower without receiving damage; however, 
        towers will fire upon players if there are no minions nearby or the player attacks an enemy player under their tower. If a game is going badly for a certain 
        team, they can decide to surrender after at least 10 minutes, though this requires a majority of the team (4 players to 1) to agree.

        Ook worden oni's als onzichtbaar gezien, of in de gedaante van dieren. Vooral de vossen-oni is berucht, maar deze is ook de trouwe metgezel van de 
        rijstgod Inari (zie ook Kitsune).
